1 medium pineapple (cubed)
2 cups water
1 cup sugar
1 lime (juice)
2 tbsp. rum
1/2 tsp. salt

Choose a good quality pineapple.
Cut the crown (aka the leaves) and the base off the fruit.
What remains should be barrel shaped.
Quarter the barrel shaped fruit and then use your knife to cut the core (the woody center) away. Place flat on a board and then run your knife between the fruit and the skin.
Slice up the remaining fruit into small pieces.
In a large pot over medium heat, add the sliced pineapple, the sugar and the water. Cook for about 15 min. or until the liquid begins to be viscous or the pineapple begins to fall apart.
Transfer the mix to a blender.
Add the salt, lime juice and rum, and blend (or “blitz,” if that’s your vernacular) for 30 seconds, or until the pineapple is completely broken up. Transfer to the refrigerator and let cool for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
Churn your mixture in an ice cream maker according to instructions. Once firm, transfer to the freezer and let finish setting for approximately two hours. Enjoy.
